            As cities across the world become bigger and smarter, they need faster and more enhanced technologies to run them and augmented reality can help transportation systems more efficient, delay-free and above all — safer.

            With mass transit on the rise globally and smart city programs being announced by governments worldwide, augmented reality (AR) has the potential to empower public transport with a self-support system for millions of travelers.

            A recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation stated, “Over 300 million residents use the nation’s transportation system every day.” Even globally, all big cities of the world — from London to New York, to Tokyo, Moscow and Madrid — have one thing in common: An expansive mass transit network that forms the lifeline for citizens. However, for a newcomer, taking a subway in any of these cities is a challenge. Reading, following and decoding the intricate web of subway maps can be tricky to say the least. While a one-to-one comparison may see London’s subway map marked with distinct red (Central Line), dark blue (Piccadily Line) and pink (Hammersmith & City Line) score over the plain A, B, C, D, F lines of the maze seen from New York City’s subway system, the fact remains that these subway maps are difficult to decipher for the common traveler.

            For foreign travelers, AR can make finding your way around — or getting train or bus information — an absolute breeze. Commuters can just hold their phones on top of subway maps to see current location and real-time movement of trains and buses on different routes. AR can make these subway maps come to life with animated trains or buses, hotspots that mark the level of turnstile activity at different stations and the estimated time of arrival of their specific train or bus. AR can also help commuters to easily navigate to the nearest subway station by using their current location and the latitude and longitude of the station. Commuters can also get other information like nearby restaurants, places of interest and more by just pointing their phones in different directions.

               AR overlays digital information on users’ physical environment or live video feeds in real time. Thus, the user no longer needs to search for information. By just pointing a mobile phone or a tablet in a certain direction, location, neighborhood, kiosk or monument, it can stimulate virtual elements that deliver all the relevant information needed in real-time.

               Advanced technologies like AR are emerging as the perfect tool to simplify mega transport networks and systems and make them more comprehensible and personalized. Imagine reading the New York subway map, but in an animated format that gives you precisely the information you are looking for, without the criss-cross lines.
