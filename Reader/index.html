            This chapter argues that gender-sensitive policy and design is an essential requirement for any public transport planning, strategy and infrastructure. Before any policy is formulated, the perspectives of women1 and gender-diverse people need to be engaged. Following this, and through every step of decision making and process, a gender lens (making the too-often-invisible actions of gender visible) is critical. Every decision has design implications and every aspect of design has differing impacts for the many different groups affected by and using public transport. The deployment of a gender lens will positively impact women’s experiences of public transport, and will maximise the sustainability, viability and equity of access to and use of public transport.

            Public transport is critical to the full and productive functioning of a society. It not only enables efficient and sustainable economic connectivity, but the personal mobility it empowers supports the fundamental human right to social inclusion by removing barriers to education, training, leisure, employment, and health and social services. In short, mobility is “both an economic development and a human rights issue, a matter of individual access to public space and an equitable share of collective resources”. More than that, access to and ease of use of public transport is critical for a wide range of complex socio-cultural processes. As urban planner Carolyn Whitzman argues, cities are highly complex and dynamic places where citizens can also find, create, and recreate their identities.
